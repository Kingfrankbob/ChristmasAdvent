## Days Im not doing
### Day 12: 
#### Why?
It involves the implementation of a Dijkstra Algorithm, which I do not have enough time to implement in c#.
OOF DO NOT RUN 12 as of 12/14/2022 IT WILL ONLY CONSUME MEM AND NOTHING HAPPENS!
### Day 8 P2
#### Why?
I cannot get it to work no matter what I do. I even tried to mod it like Brad Wilson and still no luck xd.
### Day 16
#### Why?
Well I was on ths stream with brad, and it was not working; plus using his method (currently working) it took 15 min. to find the correct path.
I did help a bit ig, giving ideas but other than that I do not know how to do such things
### Day 19
#### Uh...
I did it, just never got it to work correctly; Need to work on it when I know more in the matter;
### Day 22
#### Only Part 2 tho...
My solution is Brad Wilsons, as listed Below. He manually entered the data. I myself attempted that but to no avail. Good luck to everyone!!!
### Days 23, 24
#### I do not have the time to work on them!
I decided that I since I need to finish day 17 and 25 I am going to stop my work on these, and use Brad Wilsons solutions, again link to his repo below. 

## Credits
Brad Wilson and his repo have been a great help: https://github.com/bradwilson/advent-2022/

## How much do I do?
I have done most of the days myself without reference, but those which I did not, I did write a note I believe.
## WHAT?
Some of these commits have been so big that I have to change the allowed commit size XD!
