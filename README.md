## Days Im not doing
Day 12: 
### Why?
It involves the implementation of a Dijkstra Algorithm, which I do not have enough time to implement in c#.

## Credits
Brad Wilson and his repo have been a great help: https://github.com/bradwilson/advent-2022/blob/main/day13/Program.cs (I have not used his in most of them!)

## How much do I do?
I have done most of the days myself without reference, but those which I did not, I did write a note I believe.
